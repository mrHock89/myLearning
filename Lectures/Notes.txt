Array: 
-> An array is a data structure that stores multiple items of data in a contiguous block of memory locations.
-> All data in an array must be of the same type, such as an integer or string. 
-> Arrays use an index system that starts at 0 and goes up to n-1, where n is the size of the array. 
-> Arrays are used to store and organize data, and to help identify where each piece of data is located. 
-> Arrays are used in almost every program and are among the oldest and most important data structures.
-> Two-dimensional arrays are sometimes called matrices because they can represent a mathematical matrix as a two-dimensional grid.
-> Array is linear.
-> If we pass an array as argument reference is passed to the function

Linear Search:
-> Time Complexity : 0(n);
-> Known as linear because of it's time complexity is linear.
